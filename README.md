Created project to learn OOP and TDD. Idea of this project was to make my one-week illness not so boring as it was.
I had a lot of fun making it. Since the beginning, purpose of this project was more learning than using it.

How to use it:
It is written in python 3.6, so at least python3.6 is needed to run this project.

Needed modules install by using Requirements py:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

To check options how to start it run:
python main.py --help
